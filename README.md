## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup.
-   CSS custom properties.
-   Flexbox.
-   Node JS.
-   Mobile-first workflow.
-   EJS Embedded JavaScript templating.
-   [express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node JS framework
-   [Animation](https://animejs.com/) - For animation
-   [Navbar Component](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For navbar

### What I learned

  What I learned during the process of building this project was how to combine DOM with node.js app. It was the first time for me to combine both of them, and I feel express framework made it easier for me to be capable of that by using express middleware. Also, I am very proud of being capable of reading someone else code online.

### Continued development

    In the future, I would love to love animate my web apps on my own. I was pretty
    fun to animate my web page, and then online community in general love my project.
